# You can execute run_init.sh only "once"
# This creates LMs, basic task files, basic models, 
# baseline results without speech enhancement techniques, and so on.
# Please set a main root directory of the CHiME3 data
# If you use kaldi scripts distributed in the CHiME3 data, 
chime3_data=`pwd`/../.. 
# Otherwise, please specify it, e.g., 
# chime3_data=/local_data/watanabe/work/201410CHiME3/CHiME3
local/run_init_nowsj0.sh $chime3_data

# GMM based ASR experiment
# Please set a directory of your speech enhancement method.
# run_gmm.sh can be done every time when you change a speech enhancement technique.
# The directory structure and audio files must follow the attached baseline enhancement directory
enhancement_method=enhanced
enhancement_data=$chime3_data/data/audio/16kHz/$enhancement_method

# DNN based ASR experiment
# Since it takes time to evaluate DNN, we make the GMM and DNN scripts separately.
# You may execute it after you would have promising results using GMM-based ASR experiments
